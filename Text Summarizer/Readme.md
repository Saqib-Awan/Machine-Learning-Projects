**Text Summarizer**

This script allows users to summarize text by scoring and selecting the most significant sentences based on word frequency. It removes punctuation and stop words, calculates word frequencies, and then scores sentences to generate a concise summary. The tool uses NLTK for text processing and requires the punkt and stopwords data packages.
